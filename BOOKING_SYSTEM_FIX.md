# Booking System Fix - Database Schema Alignment

## Issue
The application was using a unified `Booking` model that doesn't exist in the Prisma schema. The actual schema has three separate booking models:
- `PropertyBooking`
- `VehicleBooking`  
- `TourBooking`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Booking Utility (`app/lib/utils/bookings.server.ts`)
A unified interface to work with all three booking types:

```typescript
// Get all bookings for a user
getUserBookings(userId, status?)

// Get a single booking by ID and type
getBooking(bookingId, type)

// Get booking by booking number
getBookingByNumber(bookingNumber)

// Update booking status
updateBookingStatus(bookingId, type, status)

// Cancel a booking
cancelBooking(bookingId, type, reason?)

// Get bookings count
getUserBookingsCount(userId, status?)
```

### 2. Fixed Dashboard Routes

#### `/app/routes/dashboard.tsx` ✅
- Updated to query all three booking types
- Combines counts for statistics
- Handles favorites from Wishlist model correctly

#### `/app/routes/dashboard.bookings.tsx` ✅  
- Uses new `getUserBookings()` utility
- Temporarily disabled cancellation (needs type-specific logic)
- Returns empty arrays for related data (to be implemented)

### 3. Routes Still Needing Updates

The following routes still reference `prisma.booking` and need to be updated:

#### API Routes
- `app/routes/api/booking.confirm.tsx`
- `app/routes/api/booking.cancel.tsx`
- `app/routes/api/booking.create.tsx`

#### Dashboard Routes
- `app/routes/dashboard.reviews.tsx`

#### Booking Flow Routes
- `app/routes/booking.confirmation.$id.tsx`
- `app/routes/booking.payment.tsx`
- `app/routes/booking.guest-details.tsx`

## Next Steps

### 1. Update API Routes
Each API route needs to:
1. Determine booking type from request
2. Use appropriate Prisma model (PropertyBooking, VehicleBooking, or TourBooking)
3. Update response structure

### 2. Update Booking Flow
The booking creation flow needs to:
1. Identify which type of service is being booked
2. Use correct booking model
3. Update confirmation and payment pages

### 3. Implement Full Cancellation Logic
The cancellation feature needs:
1. Type-specific cancellation policies
2. Proper refund calculations per booking type
3. Payment integration

### 4. Complete Dashboard Features
- Load actual accommodation/property data
- Load vehicle data for vehicle bookings
- Load tour data for tour bookings
- Properly display type-specific information

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed:**
- Dashboard loads without errors
- Booking statistics display correctly
- Favorites count works

⚠️ **Temporarily Disabled:**
- Booking cancellation (needs type-specific implementation)
- Review creation (needs booking type handling)

❌ **Needs Fixing:**
- All API booking routes
- Booking creation flow
- Booking confirmation page
- Payment processing
- Review system

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Dashboard Access**
   - Login as different user roles
   - Verify stats display correctly
   - Check all dashboard pages load

2. **Test Booking Flow** (Currently Broken)
   - Try creating a property booking
   - Try creating a vehicle booking
   - Try creating a tour booking

3. **Test API Endpoints** (Currently Broken)
   - Booking creation
   - Booking confirmation
   - Booking cancellation

## Migration Priority

**High Priority (Breaks functionality):**
1. Fix booking creation API
2. Fix booking confirmation
3. Fix payment processing

**Medium Priority (Degrades UX):**
4. Fix cancellation
5. Fix reviews
6. Complete dashboard data loading

**Low Priority (Nice to have):**
7. Optimize queries
8. Add caching
9. Improve error handling
